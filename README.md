Penpot Bloom aims to build a dynamic data visualization — ideally a chord diagram or relational network — that reveals the connections between users and their roles, with a focus on:
Which types of profiles (designer/developer) are more active.

- How they collaborate and where those interactions take place.
- What kinds of actions are most common per role.
- Potential collaboration hubs (users who act as bridges between others).

This project seeks to uncover usage patterns and collaboration flows, highlight cross-functional behaviors, and offer insights into improving Penpot’s user experience across different user types.
